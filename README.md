# Data Analyst Nanodegree
# Introduction to Machine Learning
## Project: Identify Fraud from Enron Email

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
